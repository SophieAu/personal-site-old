The good news is that since React is a library and pretty mcuh forces you to to write vanillla html when it comes down to it, you don't really need to remember many React-specific a11y rules. The bad news are that just because staying accessible isn't hard doesn't mean that there aren't any pitfalls.

## Try to avoid divs (especially for interaction)

Now, `div`s are great and theny have their use cases of grouping element together (for styling or ARIA live regions) but they shouldn't be the default element. In many cases there is a semantic element that has a11y built in. And the argument of 'There's so much native styling on this' (hello buttons) is a bad one, sorry.

React allows you to add onClick handlers to every element

* don't use divs, use fragments and semantic html
* focus management (resetting keyboard focus to a button that opened a modal window after that modal window is closed.)
* mouse and pointer events
* dynaic content (Aria live regions)
