The good news is that since React allows you to write vanillla html, you don't really need to remember many React-specific a11y rules.

* don't use divs, use fragments and semantic html
* focus management (resetting keyboard focus to a button that opened a modal window after that modal window is closed.)
* mouse and pointer events
* dynaic content (Aria live regions)

* [eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y): Static AST checker for accessibility rules on JSX elements.
* [react-axe](https://github.com/dequelabs/react-axe)
* [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro): Gently nudges you towards writing accessible code by only letting you test things that the user can interact with
