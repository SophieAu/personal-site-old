As a front-end dev and hobby web developer my stack is pretty JavaScript heavy. But I'm still playing around with other languages every once in a while. I'm pretty happy with JavaScript (and TypeScript) at the moment though so there's not too much else going on...

* Web Dev Basics: [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/JavaScript)

## Web (JavaScript) Projects
* [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/) for package management
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type checking
* [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), and [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) for linting
* [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) as test runner and for 'simple' testing
* Hosting: [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for static sites, [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) for small web-apps

### Web Apps
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) for building UIs
* [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) for static sites
* [Linaria](https://linaria.now.sh/) for CSS-in-JS
* [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) as a component library
* [react-testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro) for unit and integration testing
* [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for end-to-end testing

### App Development
* [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) for mobile development


## CLI Scripts
* [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) for simple scripts
  * [Shellcheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/) for linting


## What I'm curious about
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/) for backend development
  * [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) for nodeversion management
* [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) as an alternative to React
* [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) or [Proton Native](https://proton-native.js.org/#/) for gui desktop apps
* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for larger cli scripts


## Other Tech Stacks I know

  * [behave](https://github.com/behave/behave) for BDD-style testing
  * [pylint](https://www.pylint.org/) for linting
  * [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) for package management
  * [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) for version management
