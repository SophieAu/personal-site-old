The best aria is no aria at all






# POST: Know how to hide things inclusively / enhance site for screen readers

Only use display: none or hidden if you want noone to see the thing. in other cases use the 'visually-hidden helper class that you can find everywhere. But if you want to hide something that's interactive, first of all: Why? Second: figure out how to comunicate to the user that they have 'selected' something'

## 12. Skip to content button
and in general allow people to skip to stuff using semantic html landmarks (e.g. nav, header, main, footer)

## 13. people might use the screen reader and look at the screen
Don't make the screen reader read something other than what's on the screen. it confuses the heck out of people




# POST: make sure that dynamic content is somehow announced to the user
