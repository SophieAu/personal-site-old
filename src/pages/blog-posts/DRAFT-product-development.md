So you have a great idea for a product that you're convinced will be a huge hit? That's awesome, but: Unless this is a fun side-project (which is 100% valid!) you should make sure that your future users, agree with you.

Well, before you figure that out you should make sure of one more thing: Is the thing I'll be building making the world a better place? If not, especially if your product would make the world a __worse__ place, maybe don't build your thing.

But assuming you've got a super-nice, ethical product idea: Before you start building and pouring your life savings into it, make sure you're building something people want to use. To do that, you need to continuously get feedback along the way of your product journey.


## Before you start Building: User Interviews

Generally speaking, you will have a product idea to help people do something. Before you start building your solution, make sure that people actually need help doing their thing and that your idea is the best way to help them. So, to validate your idea you'll want to do [[User Interviews]]. During a user interview you will find out how you target users experience the problem that you think you have identified and if they even need a solution to said problem.



## While Building: User Testing

Once you have a first minimal prototype you're ready for [[User Testing]]. You want to do these as early as possible to avoid spending a few months on building something that noone can/wants to use. During User Testing you only ever test one part of the product and based on the feedback you get you iterate.






## User Journey

- a user journey is one direct path without branches. it describes how *people reach their goal*, not how a user navigates through their app. it's only the app part. the whole customer flow (offline to final gol) is called customer journey
    - e.g. user wants to book a flight to X. what are their steps and how are they feeling at each step? e.g. "logs in, notices 'sale' button. is a bit excited and interested




# When you're Live

## Customer Discovery

    Talking to existing customers

    - how did you hear about us?
    - what process did you use to decide on us instead of the competition? why did you chose us? what were the other options you looked into? what made you discard them?
    - how important is this product to you? how would you feel if it didn' exist anymore?
    - how satisfied are you with the pace of development? too fast, too slow, just fast enough? too sudden?
    - how satisfied are you with the product and ustomer service?
    - who would you recommend us to?

## All the Metrics

When looking into user growth, make sure you're testing the growth of users completing your core action and not just e.g. sign ups. Idle accounts are essentially worthless.
