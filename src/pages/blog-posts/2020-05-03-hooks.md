The three main hooks which you will use 99% of the time are `useState`, `useEffect` and `useReducer`. Although the latter is very rarely used too because it's complicated as hell. It's like `Array.reduce` which I hate but love at the same time too.


## useState

Unlike props, React states are very fancy and capture, as the name says, the state of the component. This state is/should be inherent to the component and not changed from the ouside directly. A nice state would e.g. be a counter.

`setState` always replaces the old state completely. If you want to only update part of a state you need to do that explicitly.

```js
const [state, setState] = useState(initialState)

setState(newState)

// to update the state partially
setState({...state, key: newValue})
```



## useEffect
Always runs after every render/effect call. You can prevent that by adding in a dependency array. To have the effect run only once on initial render, put in an empty array. In all other cases add all the dependencies into the array and handle the conditional stuff inside the effect with an early return if applicable. ESLint should have a rule that gets autofixed on save for this too.

```js
useEffect(() => {
    if(rerunEffectWhenThisChanges == "random value where we don't want to run the effect")
        return;

    doSomething()

    return () => runThisOnCleanup()
}, [rerunEffectWhenThisChanges])

// runs on every rerender
useEffect(() => {
    doSomething()

    return () => runThisOnCleanup()
})

// runs only once
useEffect(() => {
    doSomething()

    return () => runThisOnCleanup()
}, [])
```



## useReducer

Like I already said it's similar to `Array.reduce` in that it's super useful but I have no idea what the hell it's doing. And of course you can implement `useState` with `useReducer`.

```js
const reducerFn = (state, updater) => {
    const newStateValue = doSomething()
    return newStateValue
}

const [state, updateStateFn] = useReducer(reducerFn, initialState)

// updateStateFn wraps reducerFn:
updateStateFn = (updater) => reducerFunc(currentState, updater)
```
