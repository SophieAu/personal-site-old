The three main hooks which you will use 99% of the time are `useState`, `useEffect` and `useReducer`. Although the latter is very rarely used too because it's complicated as hell. It's like `Array.reduce` which I hate but love at the same time too.


## useState

Unlike props, React states are very fancy and capture, as the name says, the state of the component. This state is/should be inherent to the component and not changed from the ouside directly. A nice state would e.g. be a counter.

setState always replaces the old state completely


```js
const [state, setState] = useState(initialState)

setState(newState)
```





## useEffect
Always runs after every render/effect call. If you don't want that, put in guards






## useReducer

Like I already said it's similar to `Array.reduce` in that it's super useful but I have no idea what the hell it's doing. And of course you can implement `useState` with `useReducer`.

```js
const reducerFn = (state, updater) => {
    const newStateValue = doSomething()
    return newStateValue
}

const [state, updateStateFn] = useReducer(reducerFn, initialState)

// updateStateFn wraps reducerFn:
updateStateFn = (updater) => reducerFunc(currentState, updater)
```



#### useState


```js
const [state, setState] = useReducer((_, newState) => newState, initialState)
```
