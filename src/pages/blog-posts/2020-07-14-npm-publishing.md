You've build a cool javascript library or plugin and want to make it accessible to the world? Awesome! Here's how to do it:

## Step 1: Create a NPM account

In order to release your packge on NPM you need to [create an account](https://www.npmjs.com/signup). Be aware that the email you expose there is going to be publicly visible.

## Step 2: Prepare your package for release

In your package repo, run `npm init` and fill out everything you're asked for. That makes sure your package is ready for release.

## Step 3: Publish your package

If everything works, the only thing that's missing is running `npm publish` to release the package.

And that's pretty much it. Your package is now live on npm!
