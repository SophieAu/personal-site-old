In the [Big Picture post]() I referred to the '5th category' of people you need to consider. All those pesky non-default people (this is sarcasm by the way). Since this is probably the least technical thing you need to think about I've constructed a bit of a case study



* language
* name
* gender
* cultural values
* address


Manliest of things:

You're selling artisinal razors made in the USA, which focus on beard-sculpting.

* white: not necessarily
* heterosexual: people who aren't straight also have beards
* cis-male: what about transmen, transwomen? although depending on your target group (manly men) you might get away with using maskuline imagery and male pronouns. Also: Women might want to buy those razors for their partners as a present.
* age group: people above 45 also have beards. as do teenagers
* first language: Assuming that your main target market is the USA you can get away with English-only. But maybe you notice that a lot of people from Middle and Southern America buy your razors too. In that case it might make sense to 
* anglo-saxon name: Some people don't have last names. Some people have very short lastnames (like one-letter-short). Some people's last names have special chars in them (O'Neill, MÃ¼ller, ...)
* christian: not everyone with a beard is christian. Muslims, Jewish people, Hindus and Atheists, and people of all other religions grow beards too.
* Western Country: People from outside the US might also be interested in those high quality razors. Do you ship outside the US (and Canada)? Do you let people know that you (don't) ship to their country?


And based on all this, here's things you might wanna change:



* address field with forced state?
* some zipcodes are longer, have letters, ...
* only mr/mrs as genders?
