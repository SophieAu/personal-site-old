[React Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) is the easiest and most comfortable way to handle global state (or global anything really). It's essentially like Redux but I don't hate it. Much less boilerplate and it Just Worksâ„¢.

You'll always want to create a context in a separate file and pass the components to wrap in as children. This has multiple reasons:

1) most importantly: if you pass the app in as a children prop it won't rerender on every context value change. Every non-prop Provider child and every context consumer will rerender when context values change.

2) pulling out all Context functionality allows you to create a clean api. The only things you'll want to export are the ProviderComponent and the useContext function. Both of them should wrap the react api.

```js
interface ContextType {
  something: Something | null;
  setAssetType: Dispatch<Something | null>;
}

const SomethingContext = React.createContext<ContextType>({
  something: null,
  setSomething: () => {}
});

const reducer = (oldSomething: Something, newInput: Something) => {
  const newSomething = doSomething(newInput, oldSomething)

  return newSomething
};

const SomethingContextProvider: React.FC = ({ children }) => {
  const [something, setSomething] = React.useReducer(reducer, null);

  return (
    <SomethingContext.Provider value={{ something, setSomething }}>
      {children}
    </SomethingContext.Provider>
  );
};

const useSomethingContext = () => useContext(SomethingContext);

export { SomethingContextProvider, useSomethingContext };
```

And then in your app root file, you use the context like so:

```js
const App: React.FC = () => (
  <SomethingContextProvider>
    <AppContainer />
  </SomethingContextProvider>
);
```

And finally, this is how you actually use the context in a component:

```js
const Consumer: React.FC = () => {
  const { something, useSomethingContext } = useSomethingContext();

  return (
    <div>
      {`Current Something: ${something}`}
      <button onClick={() => useSomethingContext(newSomethingValue)} />
    </div>
  );
};
```
